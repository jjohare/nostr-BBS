## 6. User Stories

### 6.1 Onboarding

```gherkin
US-001: New User Signup
AS A new visitor
I WANT TO create an account instantly
SO THAT I can start chatting without friction

GIVEN I am on the signup page
WHEN I click "Create Account"
THEN a 12-word mnemonic is generated and displayed
AND I am prompted to copy it to a safe place
AND my keys are stored in browser localStorage
AND I am redirected to channel discovery
```

### 6.2 Channel Discovery

```gherkin
US-010: Discover Channels
AS A logged-in user
I WANT TO see available channels for my cohort
SO THAT I can find relevant conversations

GIVEN I am authenticated with cohort "moomaa-tribe"
WHEN I view the channel list
THEN I see only channels tagged for moomaa-tribe
AND each channel shows name and description
AND I see a "Request to Join" button for non-member channels
```

### 6.3 Join Request

```gherkin
US-020: Request Channel Access
AS A user
I WANT TO request access to a private channel
SO THAT an admin can approve my membership

GIVEN I am viewing a channel I'm not a member of
WHEN I click "Request to Join"
THEN my request is queued for admin approval
AND I see "Pending Approval" status
AND the admin receives a notification
```

### 6.4 Admin Approval

```gherkin
US-030: Approve Join Request
AS AN admin
I WANT TO review and approve join requests
SO THAT I control channel membership

GIVEN I am in the admin portal
WHEN I view pending requests
THEN I see user pubkey, requested channel, timestamp
AND I can approve or reject each request
AND approved users immediately gain channel access
```

## 8. Open Questions (Requiring Answers)

### Q1: DM Routing Architecture
DMs route through local relay but are E2E encrypted. If a user wants to use an external Nostr client:
- **(a)** Do they connect to YOUR relay with external client?
- **(b)** Do they federate to public relays entirely outside your system?
- **(c)** Is external client usage explicitly unsupported?

**Recommendation:** Option (a) - allow external clients connecting to your relay only.

### Q2: Cohort Switching UX
For rare dual-cohort users:
- **(a)** Single UI with combined channel list?
- **(b)** Toggle/dropdown to switch cohort view?
- **(c)** Separate "workspaces" like Slack?

**Recommendation:** Option (b) - simple dropdown toggle.

### Q3: Admin Structure
- **(a)** Single super-admin?
- **(b)** Multiple equal admins?
- **(c)** Per-channel moderators + global admin?

**Recommendation:** Start with (a), design for (b).

### Q4: Channel Description Preview
For "request to join" channels:
- **(a)** Name only?
- **(b)** Name + description?
- **(c)** Name + description + member count?

**Recommendation:** Option (c) for informed decisions.
